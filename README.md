# diabetes_prediction
This project contain the predictions made for diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Completed project-work carried out in Python and also contains base-paper whose reference can be given as -  Sneha,N., Gangil, T., (2019). Analysis of diabetes mellitus for early prediction using optimal features selection.  Journal of Big data, pp 1-19; doi: 10.1186/s40537-019-0175-6;


I used Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Binary Tree and Random Forest Algorithm to predict the accuracy. 
Apart from that, it has also contains F1-score, Confusion Matrix and other criterias.
